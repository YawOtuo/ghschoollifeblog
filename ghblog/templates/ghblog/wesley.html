			Gey hey isnt your regular high school. 
			First of all, the school is everything in one. 
			The facilities are great except that they are few.
			 The staff are very dedicated and committed.

		<p>Carol’s service, rehearsing, running up and down. 
			Quite boring when during the covid time all activities had to be canceled. 
			</p>


		<p>As part of my daily routine, I had to be awake by 4 oclock, then bath, sweep, dress up by 4 25 be in class then.
			 I was required to work for thirty minutes. We then had to traffick( walking in a single file) to assembly. We have our breakfast , go for class, get lucnch. Rest hour after classs. Then comes the last supper. There’ll be prep and students are required to be asleep by nine oclock.
			 And then the hectic cycle begins.</p>


		<p>
			Gey hey taught me that time managaement is everything and that 24 hours is more than enough to accomplish a lot.
			 It also taught me that complaining gets no one no where.
			 Hardwork breaks no bones. Your network is your networth.
